ðŸ“– How it works
# Automation Tool Documentation
# Overview
+ The Automation Tool is a Python script designed to automate the transfer of large files from a local drive to Google Drive. It utilizes the Google Drive API to facilitate the file upload process

# Usage and installation
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/cronusinfo/gdrive-autobots.git`.
# Install the required dependencies:
2. Install the required dependencies `pip install google-api-python-client google-auth`

# Setup your API & json
+ Obtain the credentials for your Google Drive API service account:
+ Go to the `https://console.cloud.google.com/`
+ Create a new project or select an existing project.
+ Enable the Google Drive API for the selected project.
+ Create a service account and download the JSON credentials file.
+ Place the credentials.json file in the same directory as your Python script. `Set up credentials
credentials = Credentials.from_service_account_file('credentials.json')
drive_service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=credentials)`

# Guide for setting up your folder ID from local to gdrive
+ In Google Drive, each folder and file is assigned a unique identifier called the "ID". The folder ID is a string that represents the unique identifier for a specific folder in Google Drive.
+ To find the folder ID:
+ Go to Google Drive (https://drive.google.com) and sign in with your Google account.
+ Locate the folder you want to upload files into.
+ Right-click on the folder and select "Get link" from the context menu.
+ A dialog box will appear with the folder's sharing settings.
+ The link in the dialog box will contain the folder ID. It will be a part of the URL after the id= parameter.
+ For example, if the URL looks like: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ABC123XYZ456, then the folder ID is ABC123XYZ456
+ # Specify the folder ID where you want to upload the files
+ ex `folder_id = '1reYil3itb55X1JcEvIKeRyskEAholhiI'`
+ Specify the folder path from which you want to upload the files
+ ex `folder_path = r'F:\caferoo\202306__'`

3. run your script by calling out the script from your terminal 
+ `python3 gdrive.py`
note make sure you are on the right directory

#  File Transfer Process
The script will initiate the transfer process, uploading each file from the local directory to the specified Google Drive folder. Progress and status updates will be displayed in the console.

# Additional Notes
+ The Automation Tool uses the Google Drive API to upload files to Google Drive. Make sure you have sufficient permissions and storage space available in your Google Drive account.
+ Large files may take some time to upload depending on your internet connection speed. Please be patient during the transfer process.
+ The script uploads files one at a time due to limitations in the Google Drive API. This ensures reliable and efficient file transfer.
