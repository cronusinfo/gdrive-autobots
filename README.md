# Guide for setting up your folder ID from local to gdrive
+ In Google Drive, each folder and file is assigned a unique identifier called the "ID". The folder ID is a string that represents the unique identifier for a specific folder in Google Drive.
+ To find the folder ID:
+ Go to Google Drive (https://drive.google.com) and sign in with your Google account.
+ Locate the folder you want to upload files into.
+ Right-click on the folder and select "Get link" from the context menu.
+ A dialog box will appear with the folder's sharing settings.
+ The link in the dialog box will contain the folder ID. It will be a part of the URL after the id= parameter.
+ For example, if the URL looks like: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ABC123XYZ456, then the folder ID is ABC123XYZ456
+ # Specify the folder ID where you want to upload the files
ex `folder_id = '1reYil3itb55X1JcEvIKeRyskEAholhiI'`
+ Specify the folder path from which you want to upload the files
ex `folder_path = r'F:\caferoo\202306__'`
